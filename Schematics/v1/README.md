This was our original schematic and PCB layout design.

This PCB wasn't great as the components were close together which made it difficult to solder. Additionally, the resistor size that we were using were way too small and required the use of tweezers and a microscope to solder them onto the PCB. In our new design, we removed the screen from being on the PCB which gave us more room to spread parts out.
